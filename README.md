hough_transform
===============

an implementation for Hough transform algorithm for finding lines in the image (black&amp;white)

Warning: 
 - using PIL (or Pillow, it's analog), Windows-only python image library
 - using Python 2.7
 
TODO:
 - something with repeating lines (ideas: local maximums and/or adding votes to nearest lines)
